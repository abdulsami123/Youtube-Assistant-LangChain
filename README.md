This project was motivated by a need to get an excerpt of the videos that youtube recommended but were so I wouldn't be able to watch them but I'd still like to know if they had anything of interest to me. The vision for this project going forward is to make it a learning assistant therefore I'll be adding features based on my needs ( I am the PM and I am the consumer - we are in complete harmony, this ideal case is also my entry point towards user driven development of products )
